LiveLight connects professional lighting control hardware with the audiences&amp;rsquo; smart devices over public networks (4G, 5G, WiFi) to control their screens in almost real time, making them part of the show, not just spectators.
How does it do it? The event&amp;rsquo;s lighting controller connects to an up loader box which uses our proprietary software to upload that data to a dedicated cloud server. Users who want to be part of the show, connect to the cloud server either via web-link or our iOS or Android app (currently in development) and immediately become a pixel in your show.</description></item><item><title>Products</title><link>https://www.saucalivelight.com/products/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Apr 2023 23:56:58 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.saucalivelight.com/products/</guid><description>What? Turn audience members’ smart devices (phones, watches, wearables) into a massive canvas of pixels available as an ‘extra rig’ to professional light show designers.

They love live music, and they love working in the industry, but it was obvious that watching streamed events at home just wasn&amp;rsquo;t the same as being there.
So, like all good entrepreneurs, they turned a crisis into an opportunity and Sauca Live Light, was born.</description></item><item><title>Contact</title><link>https://www.saucalivelight.com/contact/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.saucalivelight.com/contact/</guid><description>If you want to know more about Sauca Live Light, drop us a line.
