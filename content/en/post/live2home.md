We at Sauca Live Light are poised to launch yet another, new and totally unique technology to the entertainment industry at Plasa Leeds 2023!

Our recently patented technology represents the next significant step in the Sauca development roadmap, and we can guarantee that nothing like this has ever been seen before. 

Saucaâ€™s founder and innovative powerhouse, Simon Carter, has wowed us again with his insight and forward thinking in creating this new and ingenious development that will take the art of entertainment lighting into the domestic environment for all to enjoy.

Those will be the only clues we are giving for now, as we are all looking forward to seeing you at Plasa Leeds on stand N-C28 to show you a prototype glimpse of the future!
