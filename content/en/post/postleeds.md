**Thanking you all at Plasa Focus 2023!**   

We at Sauca Live Light were delighted to spend the time meeting industry friends as well as so many inspiring new creatives and technical talents in Leeds. 
So very many exciting and vibrant conversations about where these new and immersive lighting possibilities will take us and so many good ideas of applications we had never thought of!  

Our Sauca Live Light lovely and homely living room, really enjoyed your many visits and being able to show you our unique new development **“Live to Home”** where human created, lighting designer *"Scripts"* can be delivered to your home via the internet, to create immersive ambient lighting environments that accompany your movie, gig, game or audio book to dramatic effect!

We were also able to demonstrate and explain our award winning, **“Live to Crowd”** technology, where we turn people to pixels by creating a mappable canvas of bright, audience cell phone screens.  

We have to agree with the plasa judge who felt that:  
*“Sauca Live Light is the next chapter in audience participation!”*
