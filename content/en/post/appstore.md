Sauca Live Light are very proud to anounce that our "Live Light" app is now available to download for iPhones from the Apple App Store.

Although only available on the UK version of the store just now, our app allows you to connect to any nearby shows running at an event you are attending. 

Unlike connecting to a show via one of our Qr codes, the app allows live use of the phone's flash/torch function for even more effects live and in sync with the event light.

Because we all know that sometimes connectivity isn't always great, the app also has an offline mode that allows your phone to display a number of pre-programmed interactive effects, such as a traditional lighter, snowflakes, sound activated patterns and simple solid colour effects, so you can still join in when your network doesn't want to let you in.

Our iOS will be hitting the stores in other territories soon and our Android app will also be in the google app store in the near future.

Rememeber to download and rate 5 stars!!
